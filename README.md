# Crowd-Monitoring

A crowd refers to a distinct group of individuals belonging to a society. The phenomenon of the crowd is well-known and has emerged as a significant area of research in the field of machine learning. Analysis of crowds is used in a variety of places such as public events, visual surveillance, and virtualenvironments. This aids in the development of crowd control tactics. Crowdanalysis consists of three main steps that are pre-processing, object detectionand event/behavior recognition. The project aims to use CCTV cameras and other surveillance systems to do monitoring and analysis of a crowd. By using this technology one can detect unusual crowd behavior, determine whether social distancing is being followed, and make sure people donâ€™t enter restricted areas. The system's other components can then convert crowd movement data into optical flow, heat maps, and energy graphs.
