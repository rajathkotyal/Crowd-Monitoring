# Crowd-Monitoring

A crowd refers to a distinct group of individuals belonging to a socie-
ty. The phenomenon of the crowd is well-known and has emerged as a signifi-
cant area of research in the field of machine learning. Analysis of crowds is

used in a variety of places such as public events, visual surveillance, and virtual
environments. This aids in the development of crowd control tactics. Crowd
analysis consists of three main steps that are pre-processing, object detection
and event/behavior recognition. The project aims to use CCTV cameras and
other surveillance systems to do monitoring and analysis of a crowd. By using

this technology one can detect unusual crowd behavior, determine whether so-
cial distancing is being followed, and make sure people donâ€™t enter restricted

areas. The system's other components can then convert crowd movement data
into optical flow, heat maps, and energy graphs.
